PIXFUSER is a secure and convenient way for users to make physical world transactions using their cryptocurrency. The crypto card allows users to store their Solana securely and use them to purchase goods and services from merchants that accept Solana payments.

The project includes a web application for managing the crypto card, which is integrated with Solana's exchange and wallet for easy transactions.
